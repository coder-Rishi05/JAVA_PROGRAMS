## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered  

### 1. Basic Programming Constructs  
Covers fundamental Java concepts such as variables, operators, conditionals, and loops. These are the building blocks for writing any Java program.  

### 2. Data Conversion  
Demonstrates type casting, parsing strings into numbers, and converting between different data types in Java.  

### 3. Functions  
Includes programs showcasing the use of functions (methods) for code reusability, parameter passing, and return values.  

### 4. Strings  
Covers string manipulation techniques such as concatenation, comparison, substring extraction, and string builder usage.  

### 5. Single Dimension Arrays  
Explores array creation, traversal, searching, sorting, and manipulation in one-dimensional arrays.  

### 6. 2D Arrays  
Includes programs demonstrating matrix representation, addition, multiplication, transposition, and traversal of two-dimensional arrays.  

### 7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
Illustrates the four pillars of OOP in Java:  
- Encapsulation  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Abstraction  

### 8. Inheritance  
Programs showing single, multilevel, hierarchical, and multiple inheritance (via interfaces).  

### 9. Interfaces  
Examples of interface creation, implementation, and multiple inheritance through interfaces.  

### 10. Packages  
Demonstrates the creation and use of custom packages, as well as importing Java built-in packages.  

### 11. Exception Handling  
Programs on try-catch blocks, finally, throw/throws, custom exceptions, and exception hierarchy.  

### 12. Input/Output (I/O)  
Explores Javaâ€™s I/O classes for reading and writing data using streams, readers, writers, and file handling.  

### 13. Delegation Event Model  
Programs based on Javaâ€™s event handling mechanism, showing event sources, listeners, and event delegation.  

### 14. Graphical User Interface (AWT)  
Examples of GUI programs using Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) such as buttons, labels, text fields, and event handling.  

### 15. Graphical User Interface (Swing)  
Covers modern GUI development with Swing components like JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JTable, and event handling.  

### 16. Multithreading  
Programs demonstrating thread creation, lifecycle, synchronization, inter-thread communication, and concurrency.  

### 17. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)  
Examples showing how to connect Java applications to databases, execute queries, and process results.  

### 18. Applets  
Includes examples of applets (though now outdated), showing how to create and run them in browsers or applet viewers.
